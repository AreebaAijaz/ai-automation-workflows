With AI, they also exercised caution early on, but their attitudes are changing.\n\nAccording to the latest [Verizon Business State of Small Business Survey](https://www.verizon.com/about/news/small-business-survey), the percentage of SMBs adopting AI has jumped from 14% to almost 40% in recent years. Two of the main drivers of this adoption are a lower barrier to entry and increasing familiarity with the technology. More SMBs today use applications that incorporate AI, such as digital assistants, which have helped demystify the technology. As they continue to explore AI, they uncover new real-world use cases and find new benefits.\n\nOne major benefit is time savings. Small business owners have long had to do more with less – fewer staff and resources – which is especially challenging when having to compete with larger companies that can invest in more personnel and infrastructure. This lack of staff and resources can lead to working longer hours, which in turn can translate to burnout.\n\nTake customer service, for example. Solutions like [Verizon Business Assistant](https://www.verizon.com/business/solutions/ai-business-assistant/#benefits) can handle inbound customer questions via text and seamlessly transfer conversations over to human agents when needed. This approach extends across many daily business functions, allowing AI to handle routine work while employees focus on core business activities.\n\n> The businesses that will thrive in the coming years aren’t necessarily those with the biggest budgets, but the ones bold enough to embrace AI as their competitive advantage.\n\nBy minimizing menial tasks such as data entry, file management, email management, staffing and scheduling, and inventory management, business owners can spend more time on big-picture thinking, like market positioning, product development and growth strategies. Meanwhile, employees can focus on further enhancing customer service, producing end-products and tapping more into their creativity.\n\nAI tools are also helping to address employee management and retention rates. In fact, over 50% of SMBs are utilizing AI practices in their workstreams. Simply put, AI gives small businesses their most valuable resource back – time – so they can focus on what they do best.\n\nMore than a quarter of small and midsize businesses (28%) are using AI to scale up their social media efforts. Most businesses today operate across multiple social platforms, and while repurposing content is an effective way to extend its lifecycle, optimizing that content can be incredibly time-consuming. AI automates this process.\n\nWith AI, SMBs can gain deeper insights into their target audiences, enabling them to better identify behaviors and patterns over time. AI can help SMBs determine optimal posting times and content types for different platforms, and can test-run multiple engagement options by generating various versions and posting at strategic intervals to gauge audience reaction.\n\nAI-powered tools enable small businesses to effectively scale personalization, by crafting content for individuals rather than broad audience segments. With AI, this level of curation, once resource-intensive, becomes manageable and even extends beyond content creation to automated social media responses, allowing SMBs to engage more meaningfully with their customers.\n\n## **Always-on digital defense**\n\nSmaller businesses typically lack the resources for dedicated cybersecurity personnel. Oftentimes, they don’t have dedicated IT staff, so they may outsource, leverage operational staff, or even take on the responsibility themselves. While this approach may have sufficed a few years ago, it’s not the case anymore.\n\nBad actors have become more sophisticated, and threats are multiplying. For small businesses, cybersecurity is not a luxury; it’s a growth strategy, the same way maximizing productivity does, because less downtime translates to potential long-term revenue protection.\n\nThe challenge is that bad actors never sleep. When business owners and employees go home, their data remains vulnerable. Every business has critical data to protect, making this a 24/7 undertaking that can feel especially daunting without dedicated security staff. Thankfully, AI-powered solutions provide SMBs with enterprise-grade cybersecurity solutions at a fraction of traditional costs, effectively democratizing advanced security capabilities.\n\nAI can help automate that round-the-clock protection through pattern recognition, anomaly detection, and real-time threat monitoring. When something suspicious occurs, the system can either alert human operators or automatically contain the threat. This continuous, intelligent monitoring helps address the always-on nature of modern cybersecurity challenges – a capability that is transformative for resource-constrained small businesses.\n\nAI is fundamentally reshaping the competitive landscape for small businesses. While resources will always matter, success is increasingly tied to how well businesses can innovate, focus on customers, and deliver exceptional products and services. This shift represents a massive opportunity for agile SMBs, leveling the playing field for them to compete directly with larger companies. AI is the great equalizer.\n\nRather than serving as a workforce replacement, AI is creating a new paradigm where humans and technology collaborate. The goal is to reduce cognitive load. As AI handles routine tasks, employees are free to focus on creative problem-solving, strategic thinking, and building meaningful customer relationships. Forward-thinking businesses are already investing in AI training, recognizing that the combination of human insight and artificial intelligence creates exponential value.\n\nThe businesses that will thrive in the coming years aren’t necessarily those with the biggest budgets, but the ones bold enough to embrace AI as their competitive advantage. For small businesses willing to adapt, AI isn’t just a productivity tool, it’s the key to unlocking their full potential in an increasingly digital marketplace.\n\n## Author\n\n* [Aparna Khurjekar](https://theaiinnovator.com/author/aparna-khurjekar/ \"Aparna Khurjekar\")\n\n  Aparna Khurjekar is the chief revenue officer of Verizon Business Markets and SaaS.\n\n    [View all posts](https://theaiinnovator.com/author/aparna-khurjekar/ \"View all posts\")\n\nPublished in [AI Stack](https://theaiinnovator.com/category/ai-models-tools/ \"View all posts in AI Stack\"), [Generative AI](https://theaiinnovator.com/category/generative-ai/ \"View all posts in Generative AI\"), [Generative AI](https://theaiinnovator.com/category/ai-models-tools/conversational-ai/ \"View all posts in Generative AI\"), [LLMs](https://theaiinnovator.com/category/ai-models-tools/llm/ \"View all posts in LLMs\") and [Thought Leadership](https://theaiinnovator.com/category/thought-leadership/ \"View all posts in Thought Leadership\")\n\n* [AI](https://theaiinnovator.com/tag/ai/ \"View all posts tagged AI\")\n* [AI adoption](https://theaiinnovator.com/tag/ai-adoption/ \"View all posts tagged AI adoption\")\n* [Aparna Khurjekar](https://theaiinnovator.com/tag/aparna-khurjekar/ \"View all posts tagged Aparna Khurjekar\")\n* [SMBs](https://theaiinnovator.com/tag/smbs/ \"View all posts tagged SMBs\")\n* [Verizon Business](https://theaiinnovator.com/tag/verizon-business/ \"View all posts tagged Verizon Business\")\n\n## Be First to Comment\n\n\n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/verizon-revenue-chief-smbs-are-embracing-ai/#respond)\n\n "

Teta previously worked as a digital journalist in Washington, D.C.\n\nby [Dominick Sorrentino](/author/dominick-sorrentino)\n\nDominick Sorrentino is web editor for *StateTech*.\n\nSmall businesses have traditionally lagged enterprises in adopting advanced financial tools, usually due to cost and complexity. But that’s changing with the rapid [democratization of artificial intelligence](https://www.cdw.com/content/cdw/en/articles/software/drive-better-customer-experiences-with-salesforce-ai-agents-and-cdw.html), [predictive analytics](https://biztechmagazine.com/article/2024/02/retailers-forecast-demand-ai-and-data-analytics) and [cloud-based data management](https://biztechmagazine.com/article/2021/09/data-management-startups-how-choose-cloud-platform-and-when-go-hybrid) platforms. Today, it’s much easier for SMBs to manage financial data securely and prepare it for analysis.\n\n“One of the core issues for SMBs is the cost and sheer volume of tech applications that they have to pay for and manage on a daily basis,” says Eddie Cliff, vice president and general manager of small business and growth products at [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/).\n\nAccording to [Salesforce’s 2025 Small and Medium Business Trends Report](https://www.salesforce.com/resources/research-reports/smb-trends/), 46% of SMB leaders feel overwhelmed by having too many business tools, and 44% of them say that there isn't time to master all the technology that their company uses.\n\n“AI-powered forecasting tools are a step up from manual or traditional forecasting options that can be prone to human error and time-consuming maintenance,” Cliff says. However, these tools require quality data, and “great forecasting starts with great data,” he notes. “The same is true for AI.”\n\n[***Click the banner below** to explore new research from CDW on AI use cases and strategy.*](https://www.cdw.com/content/cdw/en/solutions/artificial-intelligence-ai/2025-cdw-ai-report.html)\n\nFor SMBs with smaller teams, the best option is to have a unified, AI-powered platform that creates a comprehensive view of their business, which can help with forecasting.\n\n“This gives SMBs a holistic picture of their business without moving from one siloed app to another,” Cliff says. This improves their ability for reliable scenario planning, all-around actionable performance assessments and predictive insights.\n\n“Financial forecasting isn't just about sales, it's about the [entire customer lifecycle](https://biztechmagazine.com/article/2023/09/why-customer-relationship-management-improves-digital-transformation). So that deeply unified platform leads performance metrics, such as customer lifetime value and retention, directly to financial outcomes, moving you beyond simple top-line revenue reports,” he adds.\n\n## A Secure Foundation for Investors\n\nCliff shares an anecdote of one company that provides fitness and wellness services through a platform that previously had an unwieldy, fragmented approach to forecasting reports. Once the company standardized on a unified solution, reports could be pulled in minutes and widely accessible.\n\n“For financial forecasting, this instantly gave the team access to centralized data that they put in one place — across customer registrations, orders, all their engagement rates — so that they could generate accurate, up-to-the-minute revenue projections and operating metrics rather than rely on outdated or manual data,” he says.\n\n[***KEEP READING:*** *Data governance fuels artificial intelligence success.*](https://www.cdw.com/content/cdw/en/articles/dataanalytics/data-governance-strategies-for-ai-success.html)\n\nHaving clear, professional reporting helped the startup attract investors since they could demonstrate operational maturity and a reliable foundation for scaling, he adds.\n\nAn integrated platform can also then maximize productivity and connect parts of the business that were previously siloed. [Microsoft](https://www.cdw.com/content/cdw/en/brand/microsoft.html?cm_mmc=Vanity-_-brands-_-NA-_-032020) Dynamics 365 Business Central, for example, allows SMBs to manage finance, operations and more [in a unified solution](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365/blog/business-leader/2025/08/28/tackle-the-future-of-business-operations-with-the-combined-power-of-microsoft-365-and-dynamics-365-business-central/) enhanced with AI features.\n\nAs SMBs think about moving beyond forecasting and predictive analytics, they have an incredible opportunity to take advantage of agentic AI, Cliff adds, especially since CEOs believe digital labor will have a greater impact on business than the internet and cloud computing combined, [according to Salesforce research](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/idc-ceo-agentic-ai-preparedness-research/).\n\n“We think of large enterprises when we think about AI adoption disruption, but agents really level the playing field for SMBs, helping them do more with less,” Cliff says, adding that it’s crucial to keep data centralized and updated to make this change a more valuable reality.\n\ncofotoisme/Getty Images\n\n### More On\n\n* [AI Governance](https://biztechmagazine.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-governance)\n* [Cloud](https://biztechmagazine.com/cloud)\n* [Data Analytics](https://biztechmagazine.com/data-analytics)\n* [Digital Workspace](https://biztechmagazine.com/digital-workspace)\n* [Management](https://biztechmagazine.com/management)\n* [Software](https://biztechmagazine.com/software)\n\n### Related Articles\n\n[Software](https://biztechmagazine.com/software)\n\n[5 Questions To Ask Before Your Small Business Adopts Google Gemini AI](/article/2025/10/5-questions-ask-your-small-business-adopts-google-gemini-ai)\n\n[Artificial Intelligence](https://biztechmagazine.com/artificial-intelligence)\n\n[Q&A: How Mission-Driven Nonprofits Leverage AI to Achieve Social Good](/article/2025/10/qa-how-mission-driven-nonprofits-leverage-ai-achieve-social-good)\n\n[Data Analytics](https://biztechmagazine.com/data-analytics)\n\n[The Multicloud Is Helping Manufacturers Get Better Analytics](/article/2025/03/multicloud-helping-manufacturers-get-better-analytics)\n\n[Close](#)\n\n### New Workspace Modernization Research from CDW\n\nSee how IT leaders are tackling workspace modernization opportunities and challenges.\n\n[Click Here to Sign Up Now](https://biztechmagazine.com/cdw_subscription_v3/register-web)\n\nCopyright © 2025 CDW LLC 200 N.

Large retailers have resources and scale, but smaller businesses are often the ones experimenting faster and closer to the customer. That contrast offers lessons for executives at companies of all sizes.\n\n**Different Scales, Different Approaches**\n------------------------------------------\n\nLarge retailers such as Walmart and Target are investing heavily in AI for revenue generation, inventory management, and competitive intelligence. They look to AI to make decisions across global operations, from optimizing store productivity to analyzing market trends.\n\nMidsized retailers, with dozens or hundreds of employees and regional footprints, use AI to drive operational efficiency. Their focus is less on differentiating products and more on integrating AI into existing systems to streamline marketing, supply chain, and store management.\n\nSmall businesses, however, take a more personal path. Often with only a few employees and deep ties to their communities, they use AI tools to fill staffing gaps, manage leads, and keep customer relationships strong. Owners may literally text with customers or rely on AI to make sure no call or inquiry slips through. For these retailers, AI isn’t about scaling globally; it’s about sustaining local trust while protecting the bottom line.\n\nAcross all three tiers, the common thread is trust. Whether through personal relationships, operational reliability, or brand consistency, retailers live or die by the confidence customers place in them.\n\nRelated story: [The AI Advantage: 3 Ways AI is Reshaping Checkout Experiences for SMBs](https://www.mytotalretail.com/article/the-ai-advantage-3-ways-ai-is-reshaping-checkout-experiences-for-smbs/)\n\n**Promises vs. Reality**\n------------------------\n\nThe shift to e-commerce offers a useful parallel. In the early 2000s, countless providers promised “one-click” solutions that would move retailers online overnight. Most of those companies failed. Their tools couldn’t deliver on the complexities of retail — e.g., managing inventory, monitoring customer reviews, tracking sentiment, and providing the same quality of service shoppers expected in-store. Today’s AI tools present a similar dilemma. They may look sleek on the surface, but without accuracy and integration, they risk undermining service quality. And in retail, poor service doesn’t just disappoint; it can permanently cost customers.\n\n**Risks of Off-the-Shelf Models**\n---------------------------------\n\nPublic large language models (LLMs) add another layer of risk. They often require sharing sensitive data, lack the context of a retailer’s unique operations, and create silos when different departments deploy disconnected tools.\n\nWalmart’s recent experiment with dozens of AI agents illustrates the problem. Each agent handled a small task, but none could “speak” to the others. In an industry where decisions about shelves, shipments, and supply are tightly interconnected, siloed agents replicate inefficiencies rather than eliminate them. This promptly triggered Walmart to change its own strategy as things [started to get too confusing](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-walmart-is-overhauling-its-approach-to-ai-agents-4b1fbc65?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAg-9JMQQEBhGS18xLVu97QvZS4z6w5Xfi9kLXLCNAYD0YwFwP2WpkhmZyowGfU%3D&gaa_ts=68bb54d2&gaa_sig=hymBiQZg3-k1--N6j5Oba6wurUW-A1ZzCgb3x0Gugxi93yVQwpm5xvmN6NnCcK-fgfWTeHjns-PRXunAn43juQ%3D%3D \"Opens in a new window\").\n\n**Why Data Ownership Matters**\n------------------------------\n\nFurthermore, retail executives increasingly see that AI adoption isn't just about new features. Rather, it's about controlling the data behind them. Customer histories, pricing strategies, and supply chain information are too sensitive to risk in public models.\n\nThe lesson echoes the cloud era. Retailers initially moved workloads to the cloud for scalability, but with AI, many are reversing course, bringing workloads back on-premise to reduce costs and safeguard data. On-prem deployments address two key issues: privacy and unit economics.\n\n**Lessons From SMBs**\n---------------------\n\nThis is where SMBs provide an important blueprint. With lean resources, they cannot afford cumbersome systems or privacy missteps. Instead, they adopt narrowly focused tools, test them quickly, and refine them based on direct customer feedback. Their agility allows them to balance efficiency with personalization and preserve the trust that keeps customers coming back.\n\nLarger retailers can learn from this approach. Rather than rushing to adopt broad, generic platforms, they can emulate SMBs’ agility and specificity, deploying AI where it supports operations most directly, while keeping trust and accuracy at the center.\n\nFor example, a local boutique might use AI to automatically follow up with customers by text when new products arrive, ensuring they feel recognized and valued. A larger apparel chain could borrow this playbook by deploying AI to personalize regional promotions or tailor inventory recommendations based on local buying habits. In both cases, the technology works best when it's narrow, accurate and deeply connected to customer relationships — not when it's spread thin across dozens of disconnected systems.\n\n**The Takeaway**\n----------------\n\nFor executives across the retail industry, the message is consistent: AI success won’t come from generic, one-size-fits-all solutions. It will come from adopting systems that enhance accuracy, protect data, and reinforce customer trust. SMBs are showing the way, and the retailers that learn from their example will be best positioned to thrive.\n\n_Suman Kanuganti is the CEO of [Personal AI](https://www.personal.ai/ \"Opens in a new window\"), a small language model platform engineered for scaled experiences that are private, programmable, and precise._\n\n[0 Comments](https://www.mytotalretail.com/article/big-lessons-from-small-players-what-retail-executives-can-learn-from-smb-ai-adoption/#disqus_thread)\n\n[View Comments](https://www.mytotalretail.com/article/big-lessons-from-small-players-what-retail-executives-can-learn-from-smb-ai-adoption/#comments-container)\n\n![Image 165](https://www.mytotalretail.com/thumb.php?src=/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2025/10/SumanHeadshot-scaled.jpg&w=51&h=51&c=true)\n\n[E](mailto:amy.flores@sparkpr.com)**Suman Kanuganti**[Author's page](https://www.mytotalretail.com/author/sumankanuganti/)\nSuman Kanuganti, based in San Francisco, is an AI entrepreneur who has been pioneering practical AI applications for over a decade.

              "raw_content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) for small businesses is reshaping the way automated tasks, creative work and complex initiatives happen in the workplace. AI for small business tools may help improve employee productivity, automate repetitive tasks and even enhance the customer experience. Small and medium-sized business (SMB) leaders are adopting small business AI for a variety of tasks. What is AI? AI is a broad term that refers to tools trained with data to complete tasks that might have previously required an employee’s input. AI tools are being developed for everything from accounting to customer service to sales. In some cases, AI may completely automate a task. For example, by searching through data for patterns and producing a report to help a small business manage inventory or understand customer purchase behaviors. In other cases, AI can be used to assist with tasks. For example, by automating scheduling for a small services business, employees can focus on working with customers. Similarly, AI might be used to create a draft sales email that a copywriter can then edit. The challenges and benefits of AI for small business The introduction of a new class of technologies offers both opportunities and potential challenges for small business owners. While many are adopting these new tools, concerns remain. Common challenges to AI adoption among small businesses include: • Cost of tools • Not knowing which tools to use • Lack of in-house digital skills and AI expertise • Concerns about privacy and data security • Potential government regulation that might impact usage However, businesses that are moving forward with AI, even on a limited scale, note a variety of benefits. Benefits can include: • Improving systems • Increasing efficiency • Select cost savings • Freeing up time to focus on strategic tasks • Business growth How are small businesses using AI?\nThere are a wide variety of use cases for AI, and finding the right synergies may help organizations capture benefits such as cost savings, greater efficiencies and higher productivity. For small businesses with unique needs and smaller staffs and budgets, AI can potentially be a valuable tool for getting more done. In fact, 45% of small businesses are reported as looking at AI solutions to free up time to spend on core business operations, according to​ the Verizon Annual State of Small Business Survey. Examples of different ways small businesses can use AI include: • Generative AI to create text, images and audio • AI-powered chatbots that can answer basic human resources (HR) questions or respond to customer service questions • Developing marketing and sales materials including copy and design drafts, presentations and social media content • Accounting solutions that can automate bookkeeping or intelligently generate different forms • Recruiting and other HR functions to help expedite hiring and potentially improve the candidate’s experience • Transcription and translation to provide real-time accessibility, notes and cross-language support for business interactions Examples of AI tools for small business The decision to adopt AI may begin with the desire to solve a specific problem or use case. Take time to consider what problem needs solving. From there, business leaders can see what options exist on the market at a scale and cost that fits their needs. Many tools have been designed with individual users or small businesses in mind, and these can be an effective place to begin AI adoption. For example, a small marketing business might want to implement more consistent proofreading across all their activities and choose to use an AI-powered editing solution on all content. Alternately, for a services company that holds many virtual meetings throughout the week, an AI-assisted meeting tool can potentially streamline scheduling, record meetings, provide transcripts and even summarize the content with action items and key takeaways for different participants.\nChoosing the right AI solutions When evaluating a tool, it can be helpful to look at factors such as: • Does this tool offer the relevant features to solve your challenge? For example, this could be helping a sales team create presentations more quickly or offering customers a better AI-powered self-service solution. • Is the cost and licensing model in line with your budget? • Are you locked into a long-term contract, or can you trial the product to see how it works for you? • Does the tool access proprietary organization data that may be used by the tool as a training resource? • Is the tool’s developer taking steps to support and maintain security and privacy?\nImplementing AI in your small business When adopting AI for a small business, there are several factors to consider: • What business problem(s) are you solving and why is AI the best solution? • What business outcome(s) will define success, both in terms of clear metrics and the user experience? • Does your team have the skills and expertise to adopt this solution, or will you need to provide additional training? • Are there specific device, network or other technology requirements? If so, what does your IT team need to support them? • If you’re planning to use generative AI for text or images, should you consult an attorney or adviser on any legal considerations? • Would third party AI technical or strategic expertise allow you to address gaps in technology or skills in your organization?\nFuture considerations for AI As the field evolves, a variety of new technologies are likely to emerge. Governments have taken a strong interest in AI, and the potential for forthcoming regulations at the local, state, federal and even global level may impact the user experience. Hot buttons may include data privacy, security and how information is used to train AI tools. Another important consideration is having the team and resources needed to make the most of AI. This may involve training your team on AI, helping overcome fears (“Will AI steal my job?”), and working selectively with partners to help extend your business’s ability to manage AI.

Unlike B2B, where decisions often involve long cycles and multiple stakeholders, B2C strategies focus on reaching larger audiences with messages that are timely, emotional, and easy to act on. The goal is to build a journey that moves customers from first purchase to repeat buying, and ultimately, long-term loyalty.\n\nAn effective B2C strategy connects your customer data with every channel you use, so you can create a seamless, personalized experience. To make this happen, you should:\n\n* **Unify your data** into a single customer view to understand who your buyers are and what motivates them.\n* **Segment by behavior and lifecycle stage** to ensure your campaigns are relevant to each audience.\n* **Automate campaigns** across email, SMS, mobile, and social so you’re consistent wherever customers engage.\n* **Reward loyalty** with personalized offers and programs that encourage repeat purchases.\n\nFor example, a fashion retailer could use browsing and purchase history to recommend new items via email, send a mobile push alert when a wishlist product goes on sale, and follow up with a loyalty offer that gives customers early access to a new collection. This kind of connected, data-driven strategy creates experiences that make customers feel recognized and valued at every step.\n\n### 3 Stages of a B2C marketing funnel\n\nMany brands base their B2C marketing strategy around the structure of the traditional marketing and sales funnel.\n\nLet’s take a look at the 3 stages you need in your funnel and best practices to follow:\n\n1. **Top of Funnel (awareness).** Introduce your target audience to your brand for the first time. At this stage in their journey, your target audience may well have never heard of your brand, and they might not even be aware that they need your products. This is commonly known as the research phase because your target customers are likely to be starting out looking for solutions to problems they’re facing.\n2. **Middle of Funnel (consideration).** At this stage in the funnel, your target customers have defined their problem clearly, and are now considering products that will solve that problem. This is the stage of the funnel where you target your audience with content that shows how your products solve that problem.\n3. **Bottom of Funnel (conversion).** When your customers reach the bottom of your marketing funnel, they’re primed to make a purchase. This is the place to go hard on the sell, with marketing techniques like urgency, FOMO and discount incentives. Work to set your brand apart from your competitors and use social proof like customer testimonials and reviews to set your product apart from the rest.\n\nOnce you understand how this B2C marketing funnel could work for your brand, it’s time to build a strategy to set the wheels in motion and start attracting new customers.\n\n## How to Build a B2C Marketing Strategy\n\nSuccess in [B2C marketing](https://emarsys.com/learn/blog/what-is-b2c-marketing/) means forging emotional connections with consumers. And today, online commerce is exploding. \n\nSo, B2C commerce is synonymous with [e-commerce](https://emarsys.com/industry-solutions/retail/) — and if you want to build a best-of-breed e-commerce website, a number of critical steps have to be taken.\n\n### 1. Create meaningful content that engages\n\nOnce you understand how consumers think when they’re in the market to buy, the next step is to attract and convert. Since automation technology will relatively “even out” the playing field within the next decade or so, as [Jay Baer has discussed](https://emarsys.com/en/resources/podcasts/smart-marketing-about-help-not-hype-jay-baer/), the true differentiators will be (a) strategy, and (b) your ability to generate better, attention-catching, even helpful/educational content than anyone else.\n\nEven the best B2C marketing technology won’t save a brand that feeds it lackluster content (and data, which we’ll touch on, too). When it comes to content, top priorities for B2C businesses include creating more interesting material, gaining clarity around what’s performing, and generating inspirational visuals.\n\n> *“The biggest challenge for B2C marketers is reaching and engaging their customers in the digital age. Consumers are looking for content, entertainment, and connections. We are not looking for ads and interruptions. B2C marketers are struggling to break through all that noise.”*\n\n### 2. Understand how consumers think\n\nYou’ve got your personas established and your marketing funnel is set up. Now it’s time to get into the minds of your customers and understand what makes them tick.\n\nIn contrast to B2B customers, B2C customers are much more likely to be motivated by emotion as opposed to a clear, objective requirement. \n\n#### **Key decision drivers for B2C personas:**\n\n* **Choice:** From how, where and when they shop to the products they add to their cart, giving your customers the ability to choose their experience with your brand is a powerful motivator.\n* **Impulse:** This is particularly true for lower RRP products. If you’re selling products for under $60, your customers could be motivated to buy on impulse, giving marketers the ability to drive sales with tactics like Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) and urgency.\n* **Wants and needs:** While customers are motivated by impulse, need is also a strong driver. Throughout your funnel, if you can convince your audience that your products are the clear solutions to their problems, you can change that ‘want’ to a ‘need’ and increase their motivation to buy.\n* **Personal goals and values:** Customers are motivated to buy products that align with their own ambitions, as well as their own personal values. For example, if you run a clothing brand and have a climate pledge, an environmentally conscious audience could be easily motivated to engage with your brand.\n\nIf you want more bespoke information on how your customers think, don’t be afraid to ask them. \n\nCreate site surveys to collect data, and if you have a rewards program, offer customers a discount or bonus in exchange for having a quick call with you to talk about their shopping behaviors.\n\n### 3. Use an AI marketing tool\n\nUltimately, you need to feed your machine/technology high-quality and large quantities of [customer data](https://emarsys.com/integrated-data-layer/). This task is achieved most effectively by leveraging value-based content to get contacts to opt-in to receive your communications, discounts, or e-newsletter.\n\n[Conversion optimization](https://emarsys.com/learn/blog/andy-crestodina-talks-web-personalization/) is a big piece of the proverbial puzzle for revenue-generating B2C marketing strategies. Sign-up boxes used strategically on your website are one of the best ways to interest potential customers and start your relationship with them.\n\nHowever, tread carefully with freebies, and mix and match them with [personalized, AI-driven incentives](https://emarsys.com/white-paper/incentive-recommendations-whitepaper/) automatically and intelligently created by machines to boost the likelihood of conversion on a 1-to-1 level.\n\n## Boost Your B2C Marketing Strategy with Revenue-Driving Omnichannel Personalization\n\n[Watch the Demo Now](https://emarsys.com/demo)\n\n## 6 Tips For a Successful B2C Marketing Strategy\n\nNow that we’ve covered overarching strategies and key elements of successful B2C brands, let’s get into techniques and talk about how to actually acquire, retarget, and retain. \n\nWhile there’s no real shortcut or secret to viral content or brand popularity — and nothing speaks louder in B2C than a quality product — there are certain elements you can implement immediately to spur growth.\n\n### 1. Connect with customers on a personal level\n\nGeneric, copy-and-paste experiences no longer cut it in B2C marketing. Five years ago, personalization might have been an added bonus — but now, if you want to keep your audience engaged and attract new customers, it’s an absolute necessity. \n\nIt’s time to move away from cookie-cutter content and batch-and-blast sales messaging and adopt a personalized approach.\n\n* **Email** – [74% of marketers](https://econsultancy.com/reports/the-realities-of-online-personalisation-report) state that personalizing their email content increases engagement, and there are a wealth of ways you can make it happen. From dynamic blocks that update based on each customer’s browsing and purchase behavior to automated flows that trigger based on web and app activity, creating personalized email campaigns that react to customer behavior in real-time has never been easier.\n* **Blog and video content** – your Top of Funnel audience are seeking solutions to problems, and that gives you an invaluable opportunity. By creating blog and video content that tackles the topic at hand and presents actionable solutions to problems, you not only build market authority – you also show customers that you understand them on a more personal level.\n* **Web** – if a customer came into your store every Friday, you’d recognise their face, remember the types of items they purchase and be able to give them a more tailored shopping experience. With today’s tech, online shopping doesn’t have to be any different. With e-commerce providers like WooCommerce and Shopify, you can track customers and deliver dynamic product recommendations, personalized based on previous purchases and browsed products.\n\nCreate personalized customer engagements and you won’t just drive more first-time sales – you’ll grow your customer loyalty, helping to keep them coming back.\n\n### 2. Use influencer marketing\n\nSocial media is already a powerful weapon in any B2C marketer’s arsenal, but influencer marketing takes it to the next level. Influencers are content creators, typically with large online followings, that your audience are likely to view as authority figures. \n\nBy partnering with influencers, you can help:\n\n1. 1. **Build trust** – [69% of consumers trust recommendations](https://www.shopify.com/blog/influencer-marketing-statistics) from influencers. When social proof is everything in B2C marketing, partnering with influencers gives your brand the added legitimacy you need to overcome new customer objections.\n   2. **Boost brand reach** – influencers have broad audiences, which could include potential customers that you haven’t been able to reach effectively with your current marketing strategy. By partnering with influencers, you’ll tap into these new market segments, increasing your audience size and boosting your brand reach.\n   3. **Cultivate fresh content –** when you partner with influencers, they’ll likely create content to promote your brand’s product range. With their permission, you’ll have access to a wealth of fresh content that you can use to engage customers and build trust across your own marketing channels.\n\nLooking to find influencers for your brand? Scour your tagged posts and hashtags relevant to your products and reach out to them or their agency to discuss a potential partnership. \n\n### 3. Go mobile-first\n\nMobile-based retail (known as mCommerce) achieved over [$542.73bn in sales in 2024](https://www.insiderintelligence.com/insights/mobile-commerce-shopping-trends-stats/). When eMarketer’s Insider Intelligence predicts mCommerce’s market share to double between 2020-2025, mobile-based commerce needs to become a priority for brands.\n\nWhen working on your B2C marketing strategy, considering desktop browsing alone isn’t enough – you need to consider how well your content will work on mobile devices, too. Many eCommerce platforms are mobile responsive as standard, but if you’re creating custom pages, it’s imperative that you test that they render properly on mobile devices prior to launch. This goes for email too – whether it’s web or an email campaign, content that clips off of a mobile screen is a quick way to damage brand trust. \n\n### 4. Create retargeting programs\n\nBy including data-driven retargeting in your existing marketing strategy, you can give customers that have bounced prematurely another chance to buy.\n\nTry creating highly relevant and targeted advertisements using first-party data. Ultimately, the goal with retargeting is to boost retention, customer reach, and revenue.\n\nIt’s commonplace for B2C brands to use programmatic ads to expand reach or to issue banner ads to retarget customers. These tactics are hit and miss. The better option is to use data to re-engage lost contacts where they spend their time and in ways that feel native to that platform.\n\nWe’re talking about social media.\n\nB2C brands can use two kinds of innovative targeting options on social media:\n\n* “Look alike” targeting to create profiles of contacts whose interests and preferences resemble those of existing and known customers\n* Retargeting of existing contacts who have abandoned browsing or buying sessions on the website\n\n> **Pro Tip:** Use social media outlets like Facebook and Instagram to ensure retargeting is native (in-stream), relevant, and personalized.\n\nB2C audiences certainly don’t open Instagram or Twitter because they want to be presented with ads — they’re regular people using social media to interact with friends and see updates about what people are up to.\n\nHowever, by carefully and thoughtfully cultivating a brand image through social media, retailers can not only subtly work in [native advertising (sponsored posts)](https://emarsys.com/learn/blog/ultimate-guide-crm-advertising-success/) that appear in-stream, but that also retargets individuals who have interacted with the brand elsewhere, like the website.\n\nSocial media creates a perfect opportunity to interact with and retarget on a customer’s terms, through their medium of preference. The ultimate goal for the retailer is to be viewed as a trusted insider and a valued addition to a consumer’s social channels.\n\n### 5. Invest in SEO\n\nFrom search to social, paid campaigns are like flicking on a lightswitch. As soon as it turns on, you start getting traffic. However, as soon as that switch is flicked off, the traffic is going to dry up. \n\nWith SEO, turning that switch on takes longer, but once it’s working, it can keep driving consistent web traffic and brand exposure for years. \n\nCombined with the rising costs of paid social traffic, SEO is a truly effective, scalable strategy for growing your brand audience and winning new customers. \n\nSEO gives B2C brands an unmissable opportunity to drive relevant, target traffic to their site from an audience seeking product information and solutions to their problems. \n\nBy devising a long-term SEO strategy focused around building a site’s expertise, authority and trustworthiness, you can use SEO to drive consistent and predictable site growth.\n\n### 6. Leverage social media\n\n[51% of Gen Z mainly use social media](https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-ecommerce/) to look up brands and new products, so when they search for yours, it’s important that you’re both present and active. \n\nSocial media doesn’t have to be centered solely around paid traffic – organic social media can be a great way to grow a loyal online community. Here are some tips to grow your presence organically: \n\n* **Create short-form video** content around recent brand activity, your products, the benefits customers can expect to see and more.\n* **Use User Generated Content** to build audience trust in your product offering.\n* Interact with members of your target audience by following their accounts and engaging with their content.\n* **Partner with micro-influencers** to increase your brand reach.\n* **Create channel-specific competitions** to attract new followers and create engaging interactions with your audience.\n\nFor many brands, building an organic social media following takes time, but like SEO, it pays dividends for those willing to put in the work.\n\n## Successful B2C Case Studies\n\nTo achieve success as a B2C marketer, it’s important that you focus on reaching your consumers at the most [appropriate time](https://emarsys.com/learn/blog/the-right-message-to-the-right-person-at-the-right-time-daniel-hagos/), while delivering perfectly tailored messages that ensure conversion and retention. \n\nHere’s a look at five ways your B2C marketing efforts will be boosted by focusing on personalization and creating one-to-one interactions.\n\n### 1. Levi’s found the right fit to improve their repurchase rate\n\n**Goal:** Levi’s Brazil aimed to enhance customer retention and repurchase rates, moving customers away from price sensitivity. The challenges included automating personalized campaigns at scale, integrating online and offline data, operating with a small team, and deepening their understanding of customer insights​.\n\n**Solution:** To address these challenges, Levi’s Brazil partnered with SAP Emarsys and Driven. CX. This partnership allowed them to maximize their use of customer data, improve their understanding of customer behavior, and enhance the personalization and automation of their marketing efforts. They implemented strategies such as welcome emails, abandoned cart reminders, back-in-stock notifications, and price drop alerts. \n\n**Impact:**\n\n* +30% of results share attributed to Emarsys implementation\n* +32% in revenue generation\n* +7% increase average order value in 5 months\n* +15,000 customers with repurchase and engagement tactics\n\n### 2. Petco’s strategy keeps pet lovers coming back\n\n**Problem:** Petco Mexico wanted to deliver a seamless omnichannel customer experience that integrated online and offline data but struggled due to the limitations of their previous platform, Mailchimp, which couldn’t scale with their growing business. \n\nThey also needed to automate personalized campaigns across multiple channels despite having a small team. They needed a robust solution that could support their high volume of customers and deliver highly personalized engagements effectively​.\n\n**Solution:** With support from the Emarsys team, Petco reimagined their email programs and connected their key marketing channels, such as email, web, digital ads, and mobile apps, into a cohesive omnichannel customer experience. \n\nThey also linked their loyalty program, which accounts for 92% of their purchases, into this integrated system. The solution enabled Petco to maximize their marketing technology investment and better understand their customers through advanced analytics and personalized, data-driven engagements​.\n\n**Impact:**\n\n* +20% increase in revenue from active customers within 90 days\n* ~300X return on ad spend\n* 15% increase in won-back customers\n* 31% increase in overall revenue\n* +40,000 new monthly users\n* 500,000 average monthly users\n\n## How SAP Emarsys Supports B2C Marketing\n\nB2C success today depends on connecting with customers in ways that feel personal, consistent, and immediate. SAP Emarsys is built to help brands do exactly that — turning customer data into insight, delivering experiences across every channel, and scaling personalization with AI.\n\nIn the following sections, we’ll explore how Emarsys helps you:\n\n* Build a single view of the customer and use it to power smarter campaigns.\n* Put mobile at the center of your omnichannel strategy.\n* Apply AI to personalize at scale and predict what customers need next.\n\nTogether, these capabilities give you the foundation to drive loyalty, revenue, and long-term growth.\n\n**Related Content:** [4 B2C Marketing Strategies to Help You Build Your Brand](https://emarsys.com/learn/blog/b2c-marketing-strategies-build-brand/)\n\n### Use data to truly understand your customer\n\n[Personalization](https://emarsys.com/personalization-engine/) starts with insight. Without a clear picture of your customers, including who they are, what they care about, and how they engage across channels, your marketing will always fall short.\n\nThat’s why data-driven planning is essential for B2C brands. By leveraging real-time customer data, you can:\n\n* Identify preferences and behaviors that shape buying decisions\n* Predict future actions with greater accuracy\n* Deliver the right message on the right channel at the right time\n\n[Data-driven marketing](https://emarsys.com/customer-data/) empowers you to move beyond assumptions and create campaigns that feel relevant, personal, and timely — the level of personalization your customers now expect as standard.\n\n### Ensure your omnichannel strategy includes a strong mobile presence\n\nMobile has become the center of how customers interact with brands. More than half of all e-commerce sessions happen on mobile, and behaviors like **showrooming** — browsing in-store while comparing prices online — are now common. In fact, 84% of shoppers check Amazon before purchasing anywhere else.\n\nCustomers also use their phones in-store to share on social, check in at locations, and browse product reviews in real time. If the mobile experience is slow, inconsistent, or confusing, you risk losing them at the moment they’re ready to buy.\n\nTo build mobile strength into your B2C strategy:\n\n* **Clarify the role of your app**: Decide whether your mobile app is primarily for loyalty, e-commerce, or brand engagement and optimize the experience around that purpose.\n* **Create channel consistency**: Make sure the journey flows seamlessly from email to mobile web to app. Discounts, loyalty rewards, and product availability should match across every mobile touchpoint.\n* **Personalize on the go**: Use behavioral data to trigger real-time push notifications, in-app messages, and location-based offers that capture intent in the moment.\n* **Explore partnerships and innovation**: Mobile competition is intense. Stand out with exclusive app-only products, strategic retail partnerships, or integrated social shopping features.\n\nA [strong mobile presence](https://emarsys.com/channels/mobile/) means making every mobile interaction feel connected, effortless, and valuable for the customer.\n\n### Leverage AI to optimize your B2C marketing strategy\n\n[AI](https://emarsys.com/ai-marketing/) has become a core driver of modern B2C marketing. By analyzing massive volumes of customer data in real time, AI can spot patterns, predict behavior, and help brands respond with personalized experiences at scale.\n\nWith AI in place, you can:\n\n* **Predict customer needs**: Anticipate when a shopper is likely to reorder, churn, or respond to an offer.\n* **Deliver 1:1 personalization**: Tailor product recommendations, content, and incentives to each customer’s unique profile.\n* **Automate decisions in real time**: Adjust pricing, offers, or channel mix based on customer signals as they happen.\n* **Optimize performance continuously**: Test and refine campaigns faster than manual methods allow.\n\nFor example, an apparel brand could use AI to identify which customers are most likely to buy during a seasonal sale, automatically trigger personalized offers across email and SMS, and then retarget those who don’t convert with tailored social ads. This creates a seamless journey that feels personal while also driving efficiency and ROI.\n\n## ​​Why is Automation so Important for B2C Marketing?\n\nFor B2C marketers, scale is both the biggest opportunity and the biggest challenge. You’re engaging with thousands, sometimes millions, of customers across email, SMS, push, social, and web. Managing that manually is impossible. This is where [marketing automation](https://emarsys.com/automation/) becomes essential.\n\nAutomation ensures your campaigns are timely, relevant, and consistent without demanding constant manual effort. With the right workflows in place, you can:\n\n* **Trigger real-time journeys** like welcome series, abandoned cart reminders, and replenishment campaigns.\n* **Respond instantly to behavior** — for example, sending a loyalty reward when a shopper makes their third purchase.\n* **Maintain consistency across channels**, so customers experience the same message whether they open an email, tap a push notification, or browse your site.\n* **Free up time** to focus on strategy and creativity instead of repetitive tasks.\n\nThink of automation as the engine that keeps your customer engagement running smoothly. AI may power the intelligence that decides *what* message to send, but automation ensures it’s delivered to the right person, at the right moment, through the right channel.\n\nWith SAP Emarsys, you can launch pre-built automated lifecycle journeys in days, not months, giving you faster time to value and the ability to scale personalization without adding more resources.\n\n**Related Content:** [11 Best Examples of B2C Marketing Automation](https://emarsys.com/learn/blog/11-best-examples-of-b2c-marketing-automation/)\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nBuilding a B2C marketing strategy from scratch can seem like an intimidating task with a lot of points to consider and even more moving parts. However, when online shopping is both the present and future for e-commerce brands, having a plan to attract, convert and retain customers is nothing short of essential. \n\nBy applying the tactics we’ve discussed, your B2C brand stands a solid chance of breaking through the noise. B2C marketing strategies that earn attention, convert website visitors, and keep them coming back are the ones that will win moving forward. The only question now is: are you up for the challenge?\n\n##### About the author\n\nMichael is Digital Content Manager at SAP Emarsys.

It sets clear goals, aligns teams, and ensures every integrated campaign, product launch, and customer touchpoint works toward the same big-picture win: accelerating revenue growth for the business.\n* Sales plans focus on tactics and revenue now, while marketing plans shape long-term brand equity. Together, they balance short-term results with lasting customer relationships and establish a competitive advantage.\n* The best sales and marketing plans evolve. By tracking KPIs, forecasting with data, and optimizing strategies, your organization can stay agile, keep go-to-market (GTM) aligned, and turn market shifts into growth opportunities.\n\nFree Resource\n\nState of Sales Enablement Report 2025\n\n[Download Now](https://www.highspot.com/resource/state-of-sales-enablement-report-2025/)\n\n“In any thriving organization, whether an enterprise or a small business, sales and marketing serve as the backbone, driving growth through deal-closing and brand-building activities,” per [Highspot’s Sales and Marketing Strategy guide](https://www.highspot.com/resource/sales-marketing-best-practices/).\n\nAnd it’s true.\n\nYour sales and marketing plan is the driving force behind your go-to-market teams’ ability to collaborate and coordinate on important activities and initiatives that ultimately accelerate revenue growth for your business.\n\nAnd marketing and sales are the orchestrators of said plan.\n\n**Here’s the issue, though:** Too many plans die in PowerPoint. They look sharp in a boardroom but fail in the field. Why? Because they don’t connect strategy to execution.\n\nIn other words, these plans don’t spell out how marketers, sales reps, and enablement personnel should align on daily actions that *actually* move deals forward.\n\nThe best sales and marketing plans cut through the noise.\n\nMore to the point, they show go-to-market teams how to:\n\n* **Focus their time so they only work on critical tasks and high-value accounts**\n* **Measure what’s working so they can identify any GTM performance gaps**\n* **Adapt fast when the market shifts and business goals change or emerge**\n\nEqually as important, the most successful sales and marketing plans force tough choices—because you can’t do everything, but you can do the *right* things *really* well.\n\nWhen you build a joint sales and marketing strategy that gets your enablement, sales, and marketing teams to work in tandem—and using the same set of AI-powered marketing and [sales automation tools](https://www.highspot.com/blog/sales-automation/)—you set yourself up to hit revenue targets, secure new customers, and drive business growth like clockwork.\n\nAnd that’s exactly what we’re going to break down for you here: how to design a sales and marketing plan that actually delivers. No fluff. No jargon.\n\nJust a clear, proven path you can steal, tweak, and launch—fast.\n\n*As the Highspot team explains, sales and marketing alignment doesn’t happen overnight. Leaders of these go-to-market teams must spend time planning and collaborating on their shared GTM strategy.*\n\n## What is a sales and marketing plan?\n\nA sales and marketing plan is a blueprint for how your company finds and wins new customers and keeps existing customers. It spells out the specific goals you want to hit and the steps each go-to-market team must take to achieve them.\n\nThe plan connects time-based, product-launch, and lifecycle marketing campaigns with activities conducted by sales representatives so everyone works from the same playbook. It also defines who you’re targeting, how you’ll reach them, and what tools and tactics you’ll use along the way to realize sales success.\n\n[Webinar] Accelerate your GTM strategy for success and drive measurable impact\n\n[Watch now](https://www.highspot.com/resource/webinar-accelerate-gtm-strategy-for-success/)\n\n### Key components of sales and marketing plans\n\nAt its core, a sales and marketing plan aligns people, process, and strategy to drive predictable, sustainable growth.\n\nA well-crafted sales and marketing plan is indispensable for the success and growth of any company, whether it’s a startup, small business, or enterprise.\n\nThis plan serves as a roadmap, outlining clear objectives, targeted customer segments, and actionable tactics to drive sales and promote brand awareness. It enables companies to understand their market position, competitive landscape, and customer needs.\n\nOn top of that, it provides a structured approach to [buyer engagement](https://www.highspot.com/product/customer-buyer-engagement/), ensuring consistent and effective communication across various touchpoints with prospects during the entire [B2B buying journey](https://www.highspot.com/blog/b2b-buying-journey/) and as they move through the sales funnel.\n\nBy defining specific goals and identifying key performance indicators (KPIs), a sales and marketing plan provides a structured framework for marketing and sales to align their go-to-market efforts. And when GTM teams are aligned, companies can generate significantly more revenue from their marketing efforts.\n\n| Sales and marketing plan components | How the component impacts GTM success |\n| --- | --- |\n| Getting buy-in from executive leadership | Without everyone in the C-suite on board, even the best ideas stall. Leadership approval ensures your sales and marketing plan is backed at the highest level, giving all go-to-market teams clear direction and authority to pursue ambitious sales goals that align with broader revenue priorities and the overall business plan. |\n| Securing sufficient budget and resourcing | Strong sales and marketing plans require financial backing to fund content, campaigns, and technology. A well-supported plan covers everything from mapping out a lead-generation strategy, to adopting AI-powered sales software, ensuring sales efforts and marketing efforts scale effectively without resource gaps. |\n| Determining your ICP and buyer personas | Defining your target market/audience ensures GTM precision. It helps the sales department and customer success teams employ the most appropriate sales techniques that boost buyer engagement and customer satisfaction—all while marketing drives website traffic and executes campaigns that convert. |\n| Establishing a clear timeline for execution | A timeline for your sales and marketing teams’ efforts ties [SMART sales goals](https://www.highspot.com/blog/sales-goals) to real-world actions. Specifically, it gives internal go-to-market and revenue teams clarity, helps external partners stay on track, and ensures sales trends and key metrics are monitored and adjusted at the right cadence to keep momentum. |\n| Implementing the right tools and processes | From email marketing automation tools, to CRM integrations, processes make plans scalable. The ideal [sales tech stack](https://www.highspot.com/blog/sales-tech-stack/) unifies sales efforts *and* marketing efforts, streamlining workflows, tracking KPIs, and creating visibility into what drives engagement, productivity, and revenue impact across the funnel. |\n| Selecting key performance indicators | Your sales and marketing KPIs show whether revenue targets are within reach. Tracking customer acquisition, customer lifetime value, customer loyalty, and campaign performance ensures you measure what matters and helps you identify the sales techniques and marketing tactics that fuel business growth. |\n| Ensuring collaboration across GTM teams | Alignment between marketers, sellers, and enablement is critical. Collaboration ensures sales goals match marketing efforts, messaging stays consistent, and cross-functional teams track the same sales metrics to drive pipeline efficiency, improve execution, and scale winning GTM motions. |\n| Conducting an exhaustive SWOT analysis | An effective SWOT reveals strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats. By mapping both internal and external factors, your GTM teams can sharpen sales techniques, refine positioning and messaging, and anticipate risks from competition, ensuring the marketing and sales teams respond proactively to developments. |\n| Analyzing market trends and competitors | Studying how others in your industry operate and monitoring broader business trends tied to your space can ensure you don’t plan in a vacuum. This analysis pinpoints gaps in your [go-to-market strategy](https://www.highspot.com/blog/go-to-market-strategy/), clarifies how your products and services stack up, and enables you to act before rivals capture your share. |\n| Forming a well-defined value proposition | A strong value prop is the cornerstone of an effective sales strategy. It makes your mission resonate with buyers and clearly explains why your products and services solve problems better than alternatives, connecting strategy to sales efforts and proving to both buyers and the C-suite why your approach wins. |\n| Choosing the ideal marketing channels | Success with sales and marketing initiatives depends on reaching the right people at the right time. Using cutting-edge sales enablement, CRM, and sales automation tools ensures your marketing collateral and related efforts generate MQLs that your reps can then engage through targeted sales outreach. |\n\n### Marketing plan template to generate new MQLs\n\nThe plan you put in place to execute your marketing strategy will obviously require more nuance than this checklist, but these are the foundational elements you need to address first and foremost to get your framework off the ground:\n\n* **Nail your ICP** so you’re fishing in the right pond. No more casting expensive nets where your dream buyers don’t even swim.\n* **Build irresistible campaigns** that make your target audience click, binge, and beg for more instead of scrolling right past you.\n* **Craft content so snackable** it’s criminal. Think [sell sheets](https://www.highspot.com/blog/sell-sheet/), videos, and guides your potential customers can’t stop sharing.\n* **Turn your website into a 24/7 lead magnet**—opt-ins, CTAs, and landing pages that work harder than your SDRs on Red Bull.\n* **Track every click, scroll, and bounce**, as these key metrics reveal which moves are magic and which are marketing dead weight.\n* **Launch ads that *actually* work.** That means laser-targeted, scroll-stopping placements that strike a chord with potential customers.\n* **Build a nurture engine** with email marketing automation tools so you can send tailored messages your MQLs can’t resist opening.\n* **Get social like a pro**. Don’t just post. Provoke. Spark convos, drop value bombs, and slide into feeds with killer creative.\n* **Feed your sales department *real* signals.** Share customer data regarding what content converts so they can swoop in hot, not cold.\n* **Test, tweak, repeat.** Treat campaigns like science experiments until your funnel runs smoother than a Formula 1 pit crew.\n\n### Sales plan template to nurture and close SQLS\n\nAs for the plan behind your B2B [sales strategy](https://www.highspot.com/blog/sales-strategy/), this checklist can ensure everyone on your sales team has the confidence to carry out their day-to-day activities, build strong customer relationships, and turn warm prospects into paying customers.\n\n* **Start with sales pipeline triage.** Sort tire-kickers from real buyers so reps spend time where deals can actually get closed.\n* **Build a dedicated sales outreach playbook.** Personalized cadences make prospects feel like VIPs, not just another name on a list.\n* **Ensure reps master approaches that spark trust fast.** They need to ask sharp questions, listen hard, and flip objections into buying fuel.\n* **Invest in an AI-powered [sales enablement platform](https://www.highspot.com/solutions/sales-enablement/)** that enables reps to tailor pitches and show up prepped and polished to sales calls.\n* **Ensure reps run demos that dazzle.** Don’t just click slides, tell stories that make buyers feel like they’re already using your solution.\n* **Use your enablement software to track [sales analytics](https://www.highspot.com/blog/sales-analytics/)** and set crystal-clear milestones so reps know if they’re crushing it or coasting.\n* **Sync with marketing early and often.** Trade battle notes on hot leads, what’s working, and where prospects are stalling out in the funnel.\n* **Sharpen reps’ [sales follow-up emails](https://www.highspot.com/blog/sales-follow-up-email/).** No generic “just checking in” messages. Drop insights, stories, or resources that push deals forward.\n* **Keep score with customer satisfaction** to ensure delighted prospects become loyal customers, and loyal customers bring referrals.\n* **Teach reps to close with confidence.** Seal the deal, lock the handshake, and celebrate like your quota depends on it (because it does).\n\n**Pro tip:** Keep in mind that the most comprehensive sales plans go far beyond quotas and timelines. They also factor in the [sales coaching](https://www.highspot.com/blog/sales-coaching/), training, tools, plays, and insights that reps require to show up prepared in every buyer moment.\n\n*The Highspot team details why constant, streamlined communication among all go-to-market stakeholders is a critical driver of sales and marketing alignment, clarity, and—ultimately—revenue growth.*\n\n## Why a collaborative sales and marketing plan is important\n\nMost sales and marketing plan templates come in two flavors:\n\n1. **They’re either too vague and generic** and don’t provide sales and marketing teams a useful framework on how to create a structured, unified plan.\n2. **They’re so bloated and unnecessarily complex** that they require an MBA and a gallon of coffee just to skim, let alone get a useful blueprint to work off of.\n\nHere’s the truth: Building a sales and marketing *plan* that actually works requires developing a joint sales and marketing *strategy* that doesn’t live in a slide deck.\n\n**Reminder:** Your plan is a living, breathing playbook that requires your enablement, revenue, sales, and marketing teams to work in tandem—every day, on every deal.\n\nBy doing so, you can more effectively and efficiently execute on [go-to-market initiatives](https://www.highspot.com/resource/webinar-accelerate-gtm-strategy-for-success/) (product launches, integrated marketing campaigns, and the like), turn marketing-qualified leads into sales-qualified leads, and hand those prospects off to sales reps to engage and nurture through the sales funnel.\n\n*That* is how world-class companies win.\n\nBecause when marketers, sales reps, and enablement personnel row in the same direction, you more capably (and quickly) achieve business objectives.\n\nThink of it this way:\n\n* **Your sales team** needs clarity on which bets move the needle so they can stop guessing and start winning with confidence.\n* **Your marketing team** needs to see what content lands and what flops so they can double down on what [fuels pipeline and revenue](https://www.highspot.com/blog/sales-velocity/).\n* **Your enablement team** needs to keep programs tight, adoption high, and execution sharp so the whole GTM machine runs smoothly.\n\nThis isn’t a one-off campaign blitz or flavor-of-the-month initiative. It’s a repeatable, scalable system for turning ideas into action and action into outcomes.\n\n| Common sales plan KPIs | Common marketing plan KPIs |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Quota attainment:** Measures the percentage of reps meeting or exceeding assigned quotas to track overall sales performance | **Marketing qualified leads (MQLs):** Tracks leads that meet set engagement criteria and are ready for sales outreach |\n| **Pipeline coverage:** Evaluates pipeline value compared to revenue targets to gauge if enough opportunities exist to close | **Sales qualified leads (SQLs):** Measures marketing-generated leads that meet sales criteria and progress toward pipeline conversion |\n| **Win rate:** Tracks the percentage of closed deals versus total opportunities to measure selling effectiveness | **Cost per lead (CPL):** Calculates the average marketing spend required to generate a single qualified lead |\n| **Sales cycle length:** Calculates average time from initial contact to deal close to identify efficiency bottlenecks | **Customer acquisition cost (CAC):** Tracks total spend on marketing and sales activities required to acquire one new customer |\n| **Average deal size:** Monitors revenue generated per deal to understand selling power and opportunities for upselling | **Return on marketing investment (ROMI):** Evaluates revenue generated compared to marketing spend to validate program effectiveness |\n| **Lead-to-close rate:** Measures the percentage of leads successfully converted into paying customers by the sales team | **Website traffic:** Measures number of visitors over time to gauge brand awareness and digital demand generation |\n| **Customer churn rate:** Tracks the percentage of customers lost over time to highlight retention challenges | **Conversion rate:** Tracks the percentage of visitors who take desired actions like form fills or demo requests |\n| **Upsell and cross-sell revenue:** Evaluates additional revenue from existing customers through expanded product purchases | **Email open and click-through rates:** Measures engagement with campaigns to identify messaging resonance and optimization opportunities |\n| **Activity metrics:** Measures rep actions such as calls, emails, and demos to evaluate productivity and effort | **Social media engagement:** Evaluates interactions such as likes, shares, and comments to understand audience reach and influence |\n| **Forecast accuracy:** Compares predicted sales revenue with actual results to assess reliability of pipeline forecasting | **Content performance:** Assesses how specific marketing assets contribute to lead generation, buyer engagement, and revenue influence |\n\n## How to ‘blend’ your marketing strategy and sales strategy for GTM success\n\nWhen marketing and sales teams chase different goals, you waste budget, lose deals, and miss market opportunities. But when both sides sync, you build unstoppable momentum. With that in mind, here’s how your go-to-market leaders can create a harmonic strategy that factors in both GTM functions’ respective needs.\n\n### Onboard cutting-edge marketing and sales tools\n\nAny marketing and [sales plan](https://www.highspot.com/blog/sales-plan/) worth its salt needs modern tech to run fast and smart. A sales enablement tool like Highspot provides sellers with real-time insights, guidance, and plays that shorten cycles and improve outcomes.\n\nWhen our sales enablement tool is at the center of your [GTM tech ecosystem](https://www.highspot.com/blog/go-to-market-efficiency/) (along with your CRM system of choice), your entire marketing team knows content will actually get used, while reps know exactly which assets to pitch.\n\nTogether, these solutions play a pivotal role in building an effective marketing strategy that prioritizes quality lead generation and enablement asset production.\n\nWhat’s more, these interconnected tools also help you build an effective sales strategy that enables reps to track potential-customer behavior and proactively respond to their actions with the *right* content at the *right* time in the *right* place.\n\n### Fuel demand with bold content marketing assets\n\nYour core marketing objective is to spark demand that pulls buyers into the funnel. Most marketing plans neglect to build bold, creative assets that actually earn attention.\n\nSo, focus on developing assets your target market would find engaging and informative so your sales team can utilize the collateral in conversations.\n\nAn exhaustive marketing plan outline should include brochures, one-pagers, demo videos, and other [sales content](https://www.highspot.com/product/sales-content-management-system/) that ‘speaks’ directly to your target audience and their unique pain points and needs and provides sales reps with the resources they need to establish and maintain strong customer relationships.\n\n[Webinar] Unlock sales and marketing productivity with artificial intelligence\n\n[Watch now](https://www.highspot.com/resource/webinar-unlocking-sales-productivity-ai/)\n\n### Align your business strategy to crush sales goals\n\nAccounting for the North Star business plan crafted by your leadership team ensures your sales and marketing efforts connect to action and outcomes.\n\nThe great sales and marketing strategies line up this macro vision with micro execution.\n\nWith each sales team member attuned to organizational objectives, you make mutual progress that translates [business goals into predictable growth](https://www.highspot.com/blog/b2b-growth-agenda-blueprint-for-predictable-revenue/).\n\n### Get on the same page about your target audience\n\nThe success of your collective sales and marketing efforts depends on an explicit understanding of who you’re trying to convert into paying customers.\n\nAgreeing on a defined target market avoids inefficient sales processes that fail to convert prospects and keeps both sides of your go-to-market coin tuned to what matters.\n\nWhen your sales team and marketing team agree on who you’re serving, every program, play, and pitch lands harder, giving your [go-to-market teams](https://www.highspot.com/blog/go-to-market-team/) a competitive advantage over others that fail to get granular with target-audience selection.\n\n### Pinpoint and prioritize your potential customers\n\nIdentifying high-value segments lets you see if you need to drive down customer acquisition costs or double down on expansion. Balancing net-new prospects with the customer lifetime value of existing customers ensures long-term gains, not just quick wins.\n\nThe sharper your focus, the less wasted sales efforts. Prioritization keeps reps and marketers aligned on where to spend energy for the biggest revenue impact.\n\n### Share data across all sales and marketing efforts\n\nData is power. Leveraging real-time [sales intelligence](https://www.highspot.com/blog/sales-intelligence/) sharpen pipeline visibility and reveal which plays actually move deals. When insights flow between teams, your sales team can act with confidence while the marketing team adjusts fast.\n\nDemocratizing sales data creates trust. Both sides know exactly what’s working, what’s stalling, and where to pivot—so you can fix problems before they cost pipeline.\n\n### Develop a sales forecasting model with RevOps\n\nCreating a sound forecasting model provides a structured framework for predicting future sales performance. This model involves analysis of historical sales data, market trends, and external factors that might impact sales.\n\nThe [sales forecasting model](https://www.highspot.com/blog/sales-forecasting) should incorporate variables like product demand, pricing strategies, and market conditions to provide an accurate estimation.\n\nA well-crafted model aids in resource allocation, inventory management, and budgeting and serves as a proactive tool for anticipating challenges and capitalizing on emerging opportunities, contributing to the sales and marketing plan’s success.\n\n### Coordinate on customer relationship management\n\n[Sales and marketing alignment](https://www.highspot.com/blog/sales-and-marketing-alignment/), as it relates to CRM, ensures smooth lead handoffs, accurate reporting, and a shared view of every account. Strong coordination keeps sales and marketing in sync, fueling stronger buyer experiences.\n\nWhen your CRM is your single source of truth for all-things go-to-market, deals stop slipping through the cracks, visibility and transparency with GTM progress improves, rep efficiency skyrockets, and relationships strengthen at every stage.\n\n## Execute your sales and marketing plan with an agentic platform for GTM\n\nRecognizing that markets, consumer behaviors, and competitive landscapes evolve, an effective plan should be agile and responsive. This involves regularly reviewing KPIs, analyzing data, and soliciting feedback to ID areas for improvement.\n\nWhether refining marketing strategies, adjusting [sales tactics](https://www.highspot.com/blog/sales-tactics/), or fine-tuning messaging, the goal is to stay attuned to shifts in customer preferences and market trends.\n\nBy fostering a culture of continuous optimization, you can adapt rapidly, capitalize on emerging opportunities, and mitigate potential challenges.\n\nAnd you can best realize this culture with an agentic platform like Highspot that has a [unified AI and analytics engine](https://www.highspot.com/product/artificial-intelligence/), Nexus,™ that drives GTM performance.\n\n“When GTM performance is off, we often blame content, training, or coaching gaps,” Highspot CEO Robert Wahbe noted in [Highspot’s GTM Performance Gap Report](https://www.highspot.com/go-to-market-performance-gap-2025/).\n\n“But the real issue?,” Robert continued. “Most teams can’t see what’s working and what’s not, so they don’t know what to scale or how to fix what’s broken.”\n\nNexus—and Highspot’s go-to-market enablement solution at large—shed light on go-to-market strengths and weaknesses so you can resolve problems quickly, unearth new opportunities, and refine your sales and marketing plan to drive growth smarter.\n\nLucas Welch\n\nLucas Welch is a communications and marketing leader with a strong background in the technology sector.
